      <h2 style="padding-bottom:10px;">What is happening in downtown Kingston: who is involved and what are the main concerns?</h2>
      <p>In the heart of Kingston, big changes are on the horizon, but some of the proposed projects seem a bit off track. Private developers and the government are eyeing towering high rises up to 25 stories tall outside of the downtown area, and more parking lots that could turn our city into a car-dependent hub. It's time for us, the citizens, to speak up for a more sustainable approach to development.

        One crucial issue is affordable housing. With the current housing crisis and Kingston's rapid growth, it's essential that new housing isn't just built but is affordable too. If we don't make sure of that, we risk making our housing problems even worse.
        
        But it's not just about housing. The way we're developing could harm our environment, leading to biodiversity loss and damage to the ecosystems near our water fronts. As residents, we need to push for plans that are environmentally friendly and sustainable.
        
        We get that Kingston needs to grow, but it should grow in a way that keeps our city's unique vibe alive. Let's make sure the development also helps revive our downtown and the broader Kingston area, bringing back lost economic potential. Finding the right balance between progress and keeping Kingston's character intact is the key to a thriving future for all of us. Let's make our voices heard and shape the future we want for our city!</p>
